Manhattan Distance
====================================
Definition: The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles.
====================================

This module allows you to calculate the Manhattan Distance between two points using their coordinates.
The purpose of this module is to experiment and learn about module creation, utilization and publishing.


Usage: 
from manhattandistance import utils
    utils.mandist(lat_from, lon_from, lat_to, lon_to) 
lat = integer or float
